The generator has a maximum power output of 100 Watts. The catheter delivers the RF power from the generator in a monopolar mode between its distal electrode (tip electrode) and a large indifferent electrode (dispersive pad or ""DIP""), which is in compliance with ANSUAAMI Standard HF-18-60601-2-2. The Generator operates in Temperature Control mode only. The generator is a temperature controlled system, where temperature measured by the temperature sensor in the Therapy 1300 Series Steerable Ablation Catheter or other compatible catheters is monitored and the power delivered by the generator adjusts within the selected limits until the desired temperature is achieved. The generator's thermocouple temperature control circuitry is based on a Type T thermocouple. The front panel displays the actual real-time power output, impedance, duration, and measured tip electrode temperature. The amount and duration of RF power delivery is user selectable, The desired catheter tip electrode temperature is also user selectable. A low pass filter is enabled during ablation to permit recording of intracardiac electrograms and alternately disables the filter during stimulation (pacing). The output power of the Generator will shut off if the measured temperature exceeds 80C or if the measured temperature exceeds the user selected temperature set point by more than 5C for more than 3 seconds.

The catheter delivers RF power in a monopolar mode between its distal electrode and the DIP electrode. The Generator incorporates a medical grade power supply. This power supply can be used for various line voltages and frequencies without any modifications. Utilizing microprocessor control, the Generator produces a continuous nonmodulated radio frequency (RF) output at 485 KHz. Its front panel displays the command power output, tissue impedance, and tissue temperature. The Generator measures root-mean-square (RMS) voltage, RMS current, and command power output by taking the average value of the product of voltage and current. This reflects the effective heating power delivered to the tissue from the catheter large electrode (tip electrode or other ablating electrodes). Impedance is calculated as RMS voltage divided by RMS current. The amount and duration of RF power delivery is user- selectable. The Generator has four (4) independent channels for monitoring the tissue temperature simultaneously using thermocouple sensor and i-channel (thermistor) for catheters using a thermistor sensor. The desired temperature is user-selectable when busing a catheter with a temperature sensor. If using a catheter with a temperature sensor, the output power of the Generator will shut off if the measured temperature exceeds 80C or if the measured temperature exceeds the user-selected temperature set point by more than 5C for greater than 3 seconds.

The enGen System is typically interfaced with a Laboratory Information System (LIS) via connectivity facilitated at the Data Management Subsystem level. By using the enGen (TM) Laboratory Automation System as a communication interface between the LIS and the clinical analyzers in the laboratory, the user can manage the workflow to the analyzers and other devices as an integrated system. This eliminates the need for the user to program tests for each sample uniquely on each analyzer. Within the enGen (TM) Laboratory Automation System, the physical routing of samples to the correct location is also automatic. The Buffer Module functions either as a location for samples waiting for results or as a storage area for empty sample tube carriers. When a sample is presented to a clinical analyzer via the Bypass module and is metered for testing, the sample remains on the track system in the Buffer module while waiting for the test results to be generated. If all test results are generated as expected and no additional actions are required, the sample is routed to a designated Exit module where it can be removed from the track system by the user. However, there are certain situations in which a follow-up action (retest of the sample) may be necessary. In these situations, the sample is routed back to a clinical analyzer via the Bypass module to complete the follow-up action. Examples of situations requiring a retest include, but are not limited to: repeat testing when a ""No Result""is generated during the initial test event, sample dilution when an out of range result is obtained during the initial test event, and routing to an alternate analyzer when the first analyzer the sample is sent to is unavailable for testing. Once the follow-up sample metering actions are complete, the sample is routed to Buffer module where it remains until testing is complete. Once all test results are obtained the sample is routed to the designated Exit module.",enGen (TM) Laboratory Automation System,2,CDRH,6/10/2014,6/10/2014 21:00,,Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics,Software anomaly: potential buffer timeout issues when using enGen (TM) Laboratory Automation Systems Configured with TCAutomation (TM) Software v3.5.,2014,0.0,0.0,1.0

Product Usage:  The HemoSphere Advanced Monitor (HEM1) is intended to be used in combination with a compatible Edwards hemodynamic monitoring technology module and/or cable and accompanying Edwards accessories and/or disposables. It provides Edwards hemodynamic monitoring technologies through modular connections. The HemoSphere Swan-Ganz Module (HEMSGM10) is intended to be used by qualified personnel or trained clinicians in a critical care environment in a hospital setting. It is a multi-use device that works in conjunction with the HemoSphere Advanced Monitor, patient CCO cable and compatible Swan-Ganz catheter to acquire and process temperature data supporting intermittent cardiac output (iCO), continuous cardiac output (CCO) and right ventricular end diastolic volume (EDV) monitoring. The HemoSphere Oximetry Smart Cable (HEMOXSC100) is intended to be used by qualified personnel or trained clinicians in a critical care environment in a hospital setting. It is a multi-use device that connects with a compatible Edwards monitor on one end and any approved Edwards oximetry catheter on the other end to continuously measure venous oxygen saturation by reflectance spectrophotometry. LEDs within the oximetry cable transmit light fiber optically to the distal end of the catheter. The amount of light absorbed, refracted, and reflected depends on the relative amounts of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood. This optical intensity data is gathered by the oximetry catheter, processed by the HemoSphere Oximetry Cable, and displayed on a compatible monitoring platform. Parameter output is mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) or central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2).","HemoSphere Advanced Monitor, HemoSphere Swan-Ganz Module, and HemoSphere Oximetry Cable",2,CDRH,2/1/2018,1/16/2018 21:01,,"Edwards Lifesciences, LLC",Pre-procedural issues related to software defects,2018,0.0,0.0,0.0
